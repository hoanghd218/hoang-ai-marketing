# Claude Code for Business - Starter Kit

Your AI Employee infrastructure. Build AI systems that do real work in your business.

## What Is This?

A ready-to-use template for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that includes:

- **5 Meta-Skills** - Claude knows how to create skills, commands, agents, hooks, and MCP connections
- **Smart Defaults** - Pre-configured settings and folder structure
- **Auto-Update Hook** - CLAUDE.md routing table updates automatically when you create new skills

## Quick Start

### 1. Use This Template

Click the green **"Use this template"** button above to create your own copy.

### 2. Install VS Code + Claude Code Extension

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you don't have it
2. Install the **Claude Code extension**:
   - Open VS Code
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac)
   - Search for **"Claude Code"**
   - Click **Install** on the official Anthropic extension
   - Reload VS Code when prompted

### 3. Clone Your New Repo

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
- Type **"Git: Clone"**
- Paste your new repo URL
- Choose a folder to save it
- Click **"Open"** when prompted

> **Important:** When VS Code asks "Would you like to open the cloned repository?" - click **Yes**. You must open the cloned folder directly, not a parent folder. If Claude can't find your skills or MCPs, this is usually why.

### 4. Start Building

Open the Claude Code panel in VS Code and try:

```
"Create a skill for researching YouTube competitors"
"Create a command to analyze my content performance"
"Create an agent that reviews my writing"
```
